DATA_VISUALISATION
    this ipynb notebook creates a plot of each feature against each output and saves them.
    and calculates the pearson and spearman correlation. saves pearson in a csv
    perform a heatmap
    Performs statistical significance testing Mann whitney U TEST to determine whether they are significantly different.

RESULTS_PROCESSING
    this ipynb notebook takes the seperate input data from each impact and combines them into one file,
    listing the max for each feature and then saving as a CSV 'IMPACT_DATA'
    searching for max for each feature and saving as csv 'IMPACT_DATA_duplicates_removed'
    comning datasets IMPACT_DATA + IMPACT_DATA_duplicates_removed = IMPACT_DATA_COMBINED

data_decode
    this ipynb notebook takes the k files and raw data text files for the new bicycle2020 swedish lab data
    and the original head lab data and returns a csv with all data in columns. e.g ACC_f_01_R_04_X, in k_files_2020 on hardrive
    calculate the resultant and rotational velocity and combine them into a csv 'FULL_ACC_f_01_R_04_X'

MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS
    this ipynb notebook performs multiple linear regression on the dataset. makes bland aldman plots and plots predicted vs actual
    performs xgboost for strain and strain rate, with changeable input feature combinations e.g. using resultants, 
    or component velocities. saves tree diagram examples  
    K-nearest neighbours method for the three feature sets. 
    Performs feature tuning
    performs early stopping trails
    calculates prediction intervals
